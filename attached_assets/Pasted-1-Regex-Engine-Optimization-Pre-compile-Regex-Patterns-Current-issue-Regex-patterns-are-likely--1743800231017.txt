1. Regex Engine Optimization

✅ Pre-compile Regex Patterns
Current issue: Regex patterns are likely being re-evaluated for each match.

Solution:

Store compiled regex objects at startup time:
import re

# Instead of this every time:
pattern = re.compile(r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b")

# Create a module or dict with all precompiled patterns:
DLP_PATTERNS = {
    "SSN": re.compile(r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b"),
    "Credit Card": re.compile(r"\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b")
}
🔢 Use Confidence Scoring
Add weights or confidence levels to each match to reduce false positives.

DLP_PATTERNS = {
    "SSN": {"regex": re.compile(r"..."), "confidence": 0.9},
    ...
}
📄 2. File Reading – Chunked + Memory Efficient

🧠 Current Issue:
Large files may be loaded fully into memory → slow + memory-intensive.

🚀 Solution:
Use chunked reading for PDFs, CSVs, and Office files.

✅ For PDFs (pdfminer.six):

from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text_to_fp
from io import StringIO

def extract_text_chunks(pdf_path, chunk_size=1000):
    output_string = StringIO()
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as f:
        extract_text_to_fp(f, output_string)
    text = output_string.getvalue()
    for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size):
        yield text[i:i + chunk_size]
✅ For CSV:

import csv

def process_csv(file_path):
    with open(file_path, newline='') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            text = " ".join(row)
            yield text
✅ For Office Files:

Use python-docx and openpyxl with similar chunking logic.

🔁 3. Parallel Regex Matching (Multithreading)

Speed up scanning using ThreadPoolExecutor:

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def scan_text_chunk(chunk):
    results = []
    for label, compiled in DLP_PATTERNS.items():
        if compiled.search(chunk):
            results.append(label)
    return results

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(scan_text_chunk, chunk) for chunk in extract_text_chunks(file)]
    for future in futures:
        print(future.result())
🧱 4. Modular Scanning Pipeline

Redesign the scan engine into clean modules:

📁 file_processor/
   ├── extract_text.py
   ├── scan_engine.py
   ├── result_summarizer.py
This allows:

Plug-and-play new file types
Easier testing and benchmarking
Separate NLP-based engines (e.g., spaCy)
📊 5. Profiling and Benchmarking

Integrate performance logging:

import time

start = time.time()
matches = scan_text_chunk(chunk)
print(f"Scan time: {time.time() - start}")
Eventually, build a dashboard showing:

Avg scan time/file type
Match confidence
Data NOT sent to AI
🤖 6. Optional: NLP-Assisted Pre-filtering (Contextual)

Run a spaCy entity recognizer to filter text chunks before regex matching:
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def prefilter_with_nlp(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return any(ent.label_ in ["PERSON", "GPE", "ORG"] for ent in doc.ents)
This avoids matching regexes on irrelevant text blobs (like table headers).

🔐 7. Sanitize & Log Before AI Send

Before any API call:

Strip or replace sensitive info: ***REDACTED***
Store both:
Original chunk
Redacted version
Add a dry-run mode for verification.
🔄 8. Async Queue for File Scanning

Move scanning to background using Celery, FastAPI BackgroundTasks, or asyncio.

Benefits:

UI doesn't block during scan
Can queue large files
Easier to scale with workers
